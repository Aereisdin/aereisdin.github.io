Welcome!

Thank you for taking the time to read this and explore my portfolio I have created! 
I am always excited to share my story and the stuff I am working on. 

To give an overview of what you will find I have created this README.

Index of Pages:

Index.html - This is the intial page that you land on. It features a carousel that displays
    a series of images that I thought were beautiful. Overlaid on each image are blurbs I
    have written that express an ideal and viewpoint I have.
    Below the carousel you will find some photos of me and a brief introduction to who I am 
    and what is important to me.

Protfolio.html - This page is comprised of a list of projects I have created and finished or 
    am still working on. As you scroll toward the bottom you will see progressively older
    projects. The idea here is to present and showcase my progress and ability growth over
    time.
